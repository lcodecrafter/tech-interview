# Tech interview Leandro Otero

Hi Napptilus team! here you have my tech interview which I really hope you find interesting, so we can have a nice talk later.

## Stack

- **Core libraries**: React, Typescript and Tailwind
- **Bundler**: Vite
- **State management**: Redux-toolkit
- **Linters**: eslint and prettier

## How to run the project

- Install the dependencies `npm i`
- Run the dev server `npm run dev`

## Additional notes

Instead of adding loading components like spinners or taking care about "not found" errors which are really important of course for a production page and good user experience, I decided to invest that
time in including Typescript in the project. It was not on the requirements of the exercise, but it is on the tech stack of the job offer so I tried my best to show you skills about that.

Have a nice day!
